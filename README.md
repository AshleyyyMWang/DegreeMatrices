# DegreeMatrices

To start, we need to download datasets from https://www.aminer.cn/cosnet. Specifically, look for datasets for Flickr and Lastfm. It would also be helpful to download from the Ground Truth Mapping section the Flickr to Lastfm dictionary. We would also need flickr_graph.graphml and lastfm_graph.graphml which are uploaded as files.

To run the code files, simply put in whether we are running Flickr or Lastfm experiments, and make sure to put in the right paths for downloaded files and datasets.

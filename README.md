# Degree Matrix Comparison

To start, we need to download datasets from https://www.aminer.cn/cosnet. Specifically, look for datasets for Flickr, Lastfm, and Myspace. Then, download "com-Youtube" and "ego-Facebook" from the SNAP database. We would also need the graphml files for the five networks which are uploaded.

To run the code files, code scripts would need to be modified depending on which network we are running the experiment on. Ideally, everything should run as long as you put in the right paths for downloaded files and datasets.

The DMC_Facebook should be easier to modify when applied to Facebook or Youtube networks for alignment. The other DMC script is easier to modify for Flickr, Lastfm, and Myspace.
